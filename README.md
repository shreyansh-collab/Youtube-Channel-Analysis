# Youtube-Channel-Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a YouTube channel's data to understand trends in video performance, audience engagement, and content effectiveness. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights to help improve content strategy, optimize video marketing, and increase channel growth.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of data collected from a YouTube channel, including details like:
Video Title
Views
Likes
Dislikes
Comments
Publish Date
Category
Video Duration

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, datetime
Tools: Jupyter Notebook

# Project Steps

1. Data Collection:
Collected video data from the YouTube API or manually exported data using tools like Google Analytics or YouTube Studio.
2. Data Cleaning:
Removed irrelevant data, handled missing values, and standardized column names.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted a deep dive into video performance by examining key metrics such as views, likes, dislikes, and comments.
 Explored correlations between views and engagement metrics to uncover trends.
4. Visualization:
Created visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to understand content performance, audience engagement, and publishing trends.
5. Insights and Recommendations:
Identified top-performing videos, audience engagement patterns, and optimal publishing times.
Provided recommendations on video length, content categories, and strategies to improve views and engagement.

# Key Insights
